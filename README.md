# PARM

![CI](https://github.com/chananele/parm/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

A package meant to provide a solution for auto-analysis of software/firmware.
Currently, support is only planned for ARM assembly, although if this is a hit, maybe 
this will change.

For usage examples, see [API.md](docs/API.md).

This project ~~plagiarizes~~ draws much inspiration (and some code) from [fa](https://github.com/doronz88/fa).
